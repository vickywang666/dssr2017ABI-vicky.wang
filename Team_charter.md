# Vision

The **vision** of the **Cardiac Mechanics Group** and **Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging Group** is to develop cutting-edge computational modelling frameworks to aid analysis of clinical and pre-clinical medical images in order to 1) enable personalised diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases; 2) improve precision and efficiancy of diagnosis by removing subjective judgements; 3) allow for mechanisms-driven treatment strategies on a patient-specific basis.   


# Mission

The **mission** of the team is to integrate state-of-the-art medical imaging technologies with computational and mathematical modelling techniques to develop novel personalised analysis cardiac geometry and function. 


# Success Criteria

Success criteria can be in multiples stages. 
- Can model-based analysis framework reproduce existing diagnostic metrics used in clinical settings?
- Can model-based analysis framework predict new biomarkers that are physiological and above existing clinical parameters?


# Team Agreement

Maintain a highly collaborative, supportive and open-minded research environment. 

# Project Team

This team consists of 5 members, roles and responsibilities for individual memeber is listed below:
- *Vicky Wang*: oversees running of all projects 
- *Bianca Freytag*: construct field-based approach to interpret medical images that measure microstructure (e.g. ex vivo DTMRI and T1 images). 
- *Jenny Wang*: develop model-based parameters estimation framework to allow for charactierisation of in vivo mechanical properties of the heart. 
- *Abdallah Hasaballa*: analyse microscopic images of extracellular matrix of rat hearts to quantify alteration of collagen network during aging and diseases; develop microstructure-based constitutive models to better characterise the passive constitutive properties of rat hearts in health and disease. 
- *Alexander Wilson*: perform pre-clinical animal experiment to quantify changes in the geometry and function of the left ventricle during the development of hypertensive heart disease. 
- *Megan Guidry*: apply personalised modelling framework to clinical 3D+t echocardiographic images to improve the accuracy and efficiencies of clinical echo examination.
