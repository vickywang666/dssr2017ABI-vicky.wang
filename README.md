# Synoposis

## This project deals with the reconstruction of **3D displacement field of the left ventricle** from the **2D tag line displacement tracked from tagged magnetic resonance images (MRI)**.

# Code Example

gfx read node InitialModel region Initialh;yModel;
gfx read element InitialModel region InitialModel

# Motivation

### This project is essential for the final stage of the analysis of tagged MRI data. Tagged MR images provide measurement of motion of the left ventricle from 2 orietations separately: short-axis and long-axis. Therefore, after tracking the displacement of the tag lines from the indiviual 2D images, the 3D displacement can only be attained using a free-form deformation reconstruction step.
